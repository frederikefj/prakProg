Testing the RK12 stepper:
y={1,0}, dydx={0,-1}
Taking a step of size 0.1 from y to y2={0.995,-0.1}
The errors are Ey2={-0.005,0}

Running the driver with RK12 method on u''=-u from 0 to 10
Like before y0 = {1,0}
A graf of y(x) is shown in Aplot.svg
The graf should follow a cos(x) curve which it does.

To further test the program an example from scipy.integrate's documentation is reproduced
A pendulum with friction is descriped by the ODE:
θ''=-b*θ' - c*sin(θ)
Using b=0.25, c=5 and starting the pendulum at θ'=0, θ=π-0.1
Solution from 0 to 10 shown in the plot "ODE.svg"
The plot looks like the one from scipy's documentation


###############[ Opgave B ]###############

Driver2 takes a genlist of x (optional) and only gives y at those values.
Driver2 also investigates the tolorance/error seperatly for each component of y.
First driver2 is tested using the ODE from A u''=-0.25u'-5sin(u):
final at x=10 y=vector
The values at 0,1,...,10 are plotted in "ODE2.svg" on top of the solution found in A.

The driver is also tested on the equation of equatorial motion of a planet around a star:
    u''(φ) + u(φ) = 1 + εu(φ)^2

Where u is 1/r, r is radius, φ is the angle, ε is the relativistic correctionThe plot "Newton.svg" shows 2 classical orbits (ε=0) while the plot "General.svg" show an orbit with relativistic effects (ε=0.01).
3 orbits (φ: 0 -> 6π) are shown in both plots. The newtonian orbits remain constant while the relativistic orbit precesses, which is the expected result.
